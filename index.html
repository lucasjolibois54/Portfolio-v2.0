            Hi! My name is Lucas and I enjoy designing & creating things 
that live on the internet. <br><br>

My interest in informatics started back in 2017 when I decided 
To study computer science in highschool. Back then I was building &
Developing circuits with arduino.  <br>
— All of that led me to where I am now! <br> <br>
 
At the moment I am a student at Zealand Business Academy, studying
Multimedia designer. I have developed at larger reach of interest within
Web- development and graphic design. At the moment my biggest
Interests are in UX & UI- design, web- development, logo design, 
Graphic design and things within that niche.
